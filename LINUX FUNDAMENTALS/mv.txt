Flags :(which are worth remembering)  
1.       -i :interactive(ask before overwrite)

  If a file with the same name already exists, it asks:
     overwrite 'Documents/file.txt'?
 ---Its good when you don't wanna accidentally replace something valuable ---                         

     
2.        -f : force(overwrite without asking)
  Ex. mv -f file.txt Documents/
  output will be  : 'file.txt' -> 'Documents/file.txt'


3.        -n : no-overwrite
 Ex. mv -n file.txt Documents/
 if file.txt in present in Documents folder then it will skip it instead of overwriting the file.txt file

4.        -v : verbose(show whats happening)
 Ex.mv -v f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt Documents/
 output will be : 
                 'f1.txt' -> 'Documents/f1.txt'
                 'f2.txt' -> 'Documents/f2.txt'
                 'f3.txt' -> 'Documents/f3.txt'
